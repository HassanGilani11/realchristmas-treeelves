Caring for your real Christmas tree is key to preserving its beauty and vitality.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Firstly, itâ€™s crucial to keep your tree hydrated. This variety requires a constant supply of water to stay fresh and green. So, make sure you check its water level daily.<\/p><p>Next, consider the placement. Keep your tree away from direct sunlight and heat sources to prevent early drying. Also, avoid placing hangers or tinsel too close to the treeâ€™s trunk, as they might damage the bark and hinder water absorption.<\/p><p>Lastly, letâ€™s not forget about the post-Christmas care. Instead of tossing your tree into the landfill, consider eco-friendly options. Many local councils offer tree recycling programs. This way, we can help reduce waste and contribute to the sustainability of our beautiful Brisbane, or at Real Christmas Tree Elves, we can take care of this for you.<\/p><p>With these tips, your tree will look great and add a touch of local, eco-conscious charm to your Christmas celebrations.<\/p>"}},"template--16799908397307__af38b6be-2272-4fa0-9bf9-d201b536ba83-button-1":{"type":"button","disabled":true,"settings":{"button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style_secondary":false,"button_label_2":"","button_link_2":"","button_style_secondary_2":false}}},"block_order":["template--16799908397307__af38b6be-2272-4fa0-9bf9-d201b536ba83-heading-1","template--16799908397307__af38b6be-2272-4fa0-9bf9-d201b536ba83-text-1","template--16799908397307__af38b6be-2272-4fa0-9bf9-d201b536ba83-button-1"],"custom_css":[],"settings":{"sectionClass":"prz-shopify-wrapper section-block sp-wrapper sb-sec","desktop_content_position":"center","content_alignment":"center","color_scheme":"background-1","full_width":false,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}},"1e69ac69-eadf-489c-83cc-2e623fadfb85":{"type":"collapsible-content","blocks":{"template--16799908397307__1e69ac69-eadf-489c-83cc-2e623fadfb85-collapsible_row-1":{"type":"collapsible_row","settings":{"heading":"Are There Any Home Delivery Services for Real Christmas Trees in Brisbane?","icon":"none","row_content":"<p>Yes, weâ€™ve got several services delivering real Christmas trees to your doorstep in Brisbane.
